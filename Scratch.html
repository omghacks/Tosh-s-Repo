		<dl> <dt><strong><em>"L-Cancelling"</em></strong></dt>
				<dd> The act of pressing Shield upon landing during the animation of an aerial attack. This allows for the character to be able to shield, jump, or attack again in fewer frames than not L-Cancelling.</dd>
				<br>
			<dt><strong><em>"Wave Dashing"</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>When a player air dodges in the direction of the ground nearly immediately after jumping. This creates a near lagless form of movement that does not require two pivots to move backwards and face the original direction. Wave Dash lengths and timings vary between characters. </dd>
				<br>
			<dt><strong><em>"Teching"</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Pressing the shield button during a window of a few frames upon landing in the "tumbling" animation. This causes the player's character to do an immediate "get up" animation or roll, depending on if the player held the stick in a direction while pressing shield.</dd>
				<br>
			<dt><strong><em>"Meteor"</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>A meteor is a move that sends a player at a downward angle rapidly. These can be meteor-cancelled if the meteored player uses his/her UpB within a certain number of frames from being hit.<dd>
				<br>
			<dt class = "sacred"><strong><em>"Wombo Combo"</em></strong></dt>
				<dd class = "sacred" style = "font-size: 20px;"> The <strong><em>Sacred</em></strong> combo. The combo of <strong><em>all</strong></em> combos. Only once has mankind been blessed with its appearance.
