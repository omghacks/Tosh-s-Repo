Hey Tosh,

Mostly made reader-friendly indent fixes and a few caps lock changes (img instead of IMG makes your life easier in terms of Sublime since Sublime doesn't recognize IMG as a self closing tag). You forgot to close some tags, so fixed that too. Don't forget about the <html> tag that surrounds everything else!

Changed the links to class = "Choice" to enable the usage of CSS instead of inline, it works now.

One more thing--might wanna make titles for all your pages so they don't say Fail 2.html at the top and stuff :P

Good work! :)
