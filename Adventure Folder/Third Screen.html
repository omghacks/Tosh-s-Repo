<p> You aren't very surprised when you find that the post you put up 3 days ago hasn't received much attention. Not thinking much of it, you start to browse /r/funny and see a post with a very familiar sounding name. Upon inspection, you quickly discover that the post in question is completely identical to your post. You find that this post already has 3,000+ upvotes and every comment thread seems to be commending the OP. Your eyes dart to the time stamp.</p> <p>2 days ago. </p>

	<dt><a href="Fourth Screen.html" style="color:rgb(100,0,100)"> Let it be</a></dt>
		<dd>These things happen. As long as the internet has existed, funny people have been reposted and you don't want to be THAT guy.</dd>
<br>
	<dt><a href="Fail 2.html" style="color:rgb(100,0,100)"> Call OP out for reposting</a></dt>
		<dd> Explain that you posted the same thing a day before, and that OP is unorginal and should take down his post.</dd>
